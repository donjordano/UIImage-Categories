A simple category for creating thumbnails from a UIImage calling object.
One method makes a thumbnail of hardcoded size and the other method is a parameterized size.

This is super useful for adding images in UITableViewCells and some kind of cover flow view.

There is no attribution required but is greatly appreciated!

Thanks for downloading,
